## Introduction
This project consists of practice projects to learn **cpp**.

Here's what learn for each project:
* cpp00: Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuf

* cpp01: Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement

* cpp02: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form

* cpp03: Inheritance

* cpp04: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces

* cpp05: Repetition and Exceptions

* cpp06: C++ casts

* cpp07: C++ templates

* cpp08: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

* cpp09: STL
